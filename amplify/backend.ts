 * Note: This code assumes the existence of an S3 bucket named 'my-existing-bucket'.
 * Replace 'my-existing-bucket' with your actual bucket name and adjust the paths and permissions as needed.
 * For more information on authorization access, visit: https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/storage/authorization/#available-actions
 *
 * Requirements for this sample:
 * 1. An S3 bucket named 'my-existing-bucket' must exist in your AWS account.
 * 2. The bucket should contain two folders:
 *    - 'public/' - Accessible by all authenticated and unauthenticated users.
 *    - 'admin/' - Accessible only by users in the admin group and authenticated users.
 *
 * Note: Ensure the bucket exists before deploying this code, as it only sets up IAM policies and does not create the S3 bucket.
